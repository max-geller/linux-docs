# IDE Overview

For a best-practice workflow using Kitty, Tmux, and Neovim on an Angular project, developers typically operate within a single Kitty terminal window running one Tmux session to streamline editing, long-running services, and temporary commands. In this setup, the main Tmux window hosts Neovim for editing Angular files (e.g., app.component.ts), leveraging plugins like nvim-tree for file browsing, telescope for fuzzy searching, and tsserver for TypeScript LSP support. A horizontal split (Ctrl+a ") in the main window creates a bottom Zsh pane for as-needed commands like ng add or ng generate, which can be closed (Ctrl+a x) when done. Long-running services like ng serve run in a separate Tmux window (Ctrl+a c), keeping them accessible via Ctrl+a n/p without cluttering the editing space. The vim-tmux-navigator plugin unifies navigation with Ctrl+h/j/k/l across Neovim splits and Tmux panes, enhancing efficiency. This approach, using one Kitty window and Tmux for session persistence (optionally with tmux-resurrect), minimizes context switching, aligns with your Hyprland setup (MOD+Enter for Kitty), and is widely adopted for its balance of focus and flexibility in Angular development.

This setup avoids Kitty tabs/panes (per your kitty.conf), reserves Neovim splits for occasional multi-file editing (e.g., :vsplit), and relies on Tmux’s robust window/pane management to organize tasks. It ensures a cohesive workflow where editing remains central, services run in the background, and commands are executed on-demand, all within a single, persistent Tmux session tailored to Angular’s needs.
